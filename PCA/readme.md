# PCA: Principal supervised machine learning technique 

It is technique is used for dimensinal reduction.That is also unsupervised machine learning technique used to avoid the multicolinarity issue . Through this method we can avoid the multicolinarity issue. In this pca will transform our orignal dataset into new dataset whoch is total diffrent from our orignal data set. And every column will be our principal column and in our new dataset every column will be indipendent to each other and that principal component are sum of all column present in orignal dataset.
